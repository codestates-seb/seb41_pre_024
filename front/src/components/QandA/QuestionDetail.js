          Excuse all the Console.WriteLines! Trying to figure out what is
          happening hereðŸ˜€
          <br />
          <br />
          The following code actually works if I run it in visual studio. The
          problem is when I compile and run it as a command line program - the
          line that tries to access an api using HttpClient completely stops the
          whole process and ends the program. No error handling , nothing. How
          can this happen? It bombs out if I remove the try/ with block as well.
          I am baffled. I'm building a dynamic table using React-Table and i
          want to add a new row of editable cells. At the moment i can add new
          row but only when i press the global edit button i can edit it,
          instead i want to add a row which would be editable at first.
          <br />
