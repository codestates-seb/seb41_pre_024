[...] I mean if in the raw data there is punctuation or number or typo, it will automatically clean [...] You need some sort of validation method here, you cannot achieve that directly on the database, you need to handle it in your logic before the rows insertion. In these cases, the best solution is to prepare a picklist (multiple choice) from which end users can choose the right values. A free text input will always be error prone.If the multiple choiceis not an applicable solution in your case, then you need to put in place a list of validation rules but you need to think how to prevent every possible issue.",
